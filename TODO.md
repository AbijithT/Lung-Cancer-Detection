# Frontend Enhancement Plan

## Information Gathered
- Current index.html uses basic inline CSS with a gradient background, centered layout, and simple upload form.
- No external libraries or images; alignment is basic text-center.
- JS for upload and prediction is functional but UI lacks visual appeal (no icons, limited responsiveness, plain styles).

## Plan
- Update HTML structure to use flexbox for improved vertical and horizontal alignment.
- Enhance CSS: Adopt a medical-themed color palette (blues/greens), add rounded corners, shadows, hover transitions, and a loading spinner.
- Add icons via Font Awesome CDN (e.g., upload icon, lung symbol, predict button icon).
- Incorporate subtle visual elements: Gradient overlays, placeholder for medical background image (e.g., abstract lung scan pattern; use CSS for now).
- Ensure responsiveness with media queries for mobile devices.

## Dependent Files to be edited
- index.html (primary file for UI changes).

## Followup steps
- [x] Update HTML structure for flexbox alignment.
- [x] Enhance CSS styles and add Font Awesome CDN.
- [x] Add icons and visual elements (e.g., header icon, upload icon).
- [x] Implement loading spinner and hover effects.
- [x] Test UI by opening index.html in browser: Verify alignment, responsiveness, and that prediction JS still works.
- [x] Confirm with user for further tweaks.
